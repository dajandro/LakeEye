        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Trophic State Index reveals Chlorophyll-a levels, which is a direct measurable health parameter for the safety of a water body. Due to the heterogeneous distribution of cyanobacteria in time and space, it is quite difficult to create a single guideline value. Therefore, a more suitable approach is a series of guideline values associated with incremental severity and probability of health effects. A scale value from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) is given to represent the risk of health effects due to Chlorophyll-a content in the lake.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Turbidity is a water quality term that refers to the relative clarity of water. Turbidity occurs when fine suspended particles of clay, silt, organic and inorganic matter, algae, dissolved colored organic compounds, and plankton and other microscopic organisms, are picked up by water as it passes through a watershed. It is an optical characteristic of water and is a measurement of the amount of light that is scattered by material in the water when a light is shined through the water sample. High turbidity can significantly reduce the aesthetic quality of lakes and streams, having a harmful impact on recreation and tourism. The results are reported in units called Nephelometric Turbidity Units or NTUs. The higher the NTUs, the higher the turbidity of the water is. Turbidity ranges from less than 1 NTU to more than 1,000 NTU. At 5 NTU water is visibly cloudy; at 25 NTU it is murky.</p>

            <h3 class="panel-title">Temperature</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>The surface water temperature is key driver of the quality of freshwater lakes and as such is recognised as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Fluctuations in temperature both on the surface and below directly impacts the chemistry of the lake and therefore the health and safety of the water. The direct effect of warming lake water is to encourage turning, stratification and the dissolved oxygen content. This is crucially important for lake water quality since the previously well mixed water body now displays a halocline and changes the overall ecosystem within the lake. As summer temperatures rise, dissolved oxygen levels fall and since this is consumed by all forms of aquatic life, it can be used to assess overall “health” of the lake. Seasonal DO lows tend to occur at the peak of summer and can result in excess organic material in the lake. This can lead to eutrophic conditions, which is an oxygen-deficient situation that can result in a water body dying and the development of algal blooms. This suggests that the water quality is likely to be at greater risk of falling during the summer peak whilst at the beginning and end of the season, the water is still relatively stable at cold temperatures with high levels of DO for a healthy aquatic ecosystem.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Due to the complexity of lake ecosystems and the impact of environmental variables on water quality, Trophic State Index has been identified as providing the most relevant observable for the purpose of the project. Whilst Temperature and Turbidity provide pertinent information for evaluating the behaviour of water-borne biological elements, the Trophic State Index reveals Chlorophyll-a levels, which is a direct measurable health parameter for the safety of a water body. Since it has the greatest weight, the Rank 1 only uses the Trophic State Index as input parameter.</p>
            <p>Whilst Turbidity can itself affect water quality, it is primarily used as an indicator of the clarity. Temperature, however, has a direct and constant fluctuating effect on lakes. Solar insolation drives the yearly cycles surrounding lake stratification in the summer seasons in contrast to a highly mixed, cold and dense water body during winter months. A lake’s dissolved oxygen (DO) content is a key indicator of the ecosystems contained within, as this is the amount of oxygen available to living organisms. As the temperature varies, so does the DO which in turn affects the entire health of the lake based upon what can survive. Given that the overall water quality is affected by many other variables including rainfall, sedimentation and runoff it is, in reality, a complex interplay between causal factors. Therefore, of the measurables available the temperature is considered to have a greater, more direct influence upon the health of a lake whilst the Turbidity values provide an assessment of ecological processes within the water and thus indirectly water quality. Finally, given that as the level of Turbidity within a lake rises, its own impact upon the water quality also increases for the two reasons given above and therefore a weighting ratio of 70:30 - Temperature : Turbidity has been chosen in order to produce the final Rank 2 result whilst clearly recognising Temperature as the primary, but not sole driver of this ranking.</p>
